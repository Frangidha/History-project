        <h2>About Julius Ceasar</h2>

        <p>
            Gaius Julius Caesar was born into a patrician family, the gens Julia, which claimed descent from Julus,
            son of the legendary Trojan prince Aeneas, supposedly the son of the goddess Venus The Julii were of Alban
            origin,
            mentioned as one of the leading Alban houses, which settled in Rome around the mid-7th century BC,
            following the destruction of Alba Longa. They were granted patrician status,
            along with other noble Alban families The Julii also existed at an early period at Bovillae,
            evidenced by a very ancient inscription on an altar in the theatre of that town,
            which speaks of their offering sacrifices according to the lege Albana, or Alban rites.
        </p>

        <p>
            Despite their ancient pedigree, the Julii Caesares were not especially politically influential,
            although they had enjoyed some revival of their political fortunes in the early 1st century BC. Caesar's
            father,
            also called Gaius Julius Caesar, governed the province of Asia, and his sister Julia, Caesar's aunt, married
            Gaius Marius,
            one of the most prominent figures in the Republic. His mother, Aurelia, came from an influential family.
            Little is recorded of Caesar's childhood.

        <p>Caesar was born on July 12 or 13 in 100 B.C.E. to a noble family. During his youth, the Roman Republic was in
            chaos. Seizing the opportunity, Caesar advanced in the political system and briefly became governor of
            Spain, a Roman province.</p>
        <p>
            Returning to Rome, he formed political alliances that helped him become governor of Gaul, an area that
            included what is now France and Belgium. His Roman troops conquered Gallic tribes by exploiting tribal
            rivalries. Throughout his eight-year governorship, he increased his military power and, more importantly,
            acquired plunder from Gaul. When his rivals in Rome demanded he return as a private citizen, he used these
            riches to support his army and marched them across the Rubicon River, crossing from Gaul into Italy. This
            sparked a civil war between Caesar’s forces and forces of his chief rival for power, Pompey, from which
            Caesar emerged victorious.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 44 B.C.E., Caesar declared himself dictator for life. His increasing power and great ambition agitated
            many senators who feared Caesar aspired to be king. Only a month after Caesar’s declaration, a group of
            senators, among them Marcus Junius Brutus, Caesar’s second choice as heir, and Gaius Cassius Longinus
            assassinated Caesar in fear of his absolute power.
