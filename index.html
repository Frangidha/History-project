        <h2>About Julius Ceasar</h2>

<p>
    Gaius Julius Caesar was born into a patrician family, the gens Julia, which claimed descent from Julus, 
    son of the legendary Trojan prince Aeneas, supposedly the son of the goddess Venus The Julii were of Alban origin, 
    mentioned as one of the leading Alban houses, which settled in Rome around the mid-7th century BC, 
    following the destruction of Alba Longa. They were granted patrician status, 
    along with other noble Alban families The Julii also existed at an early period at Bovillae, 
    evidenced by a very ancient inscription on an altar in the theatre of that town, 
    which speaks of their offering sacrifices according to the lege Albana, or Alban rites. 
 </p>

 <p>
    Despite their ancient pedigree, the Julii Caesares were not especially politically influential, 
    although they had enjoyed some revival of their political fortunes in the early 1st century BC. Caesar's father, 
    also called Gaius Julius Caesar, governed the province of Asia, and his sister Julia, Caesar's aunt, married Gaius Marius, 
    one of the most prominent figures in the Republic. His mother, Aurelia, came from an influential family. 
    Little is recorded of Caesar's childhood.
