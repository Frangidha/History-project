            <h3>Ceasar strenghts</h3>
            <p>The available sources suggest that Caesar exercised a ‘hands-on’, 
                personal style of leadership. There is little evidence of the systematic use of written orders or of what we 
                might recognise as specialised staff work.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the search for useful intelligence, Caesar interrogated prisoners and deserters in person, and summoned councils of war when he saw fit. 
                In combat, he moved around the field to assess the changing situation and to encourage his troops,
                 his trademark scarlet cloak making him easily recognisable.
            </p>
        <p>
            Caesar knew how to win and retain the allegiance of his men. He led them on rigorous marches and exercises as part of their training. 
            This was the more remarkable because his health was uncertain and he is believed to have suffered from epilepsy. 
            He insisted on strict discipline, 
            but was also careful to show his gratitude, and to lavish praise on deserving soldiers.
        </p>

        <p>all of these trade made him the legendary general he was and made him win these legendary battles</p>

            The Battle of Alesia took place in 52 BCE when Roman troops, led by Roman governor Julius Caesar, 
            fought the Gauls at the city of Alesia. The Gauls had rebelled against Caesar's rule and fortified themselves within the city, 
            located in eastern Gaul, now commonly believed to be Burgundy, France. Caesar was victorious in this battle, 
            despite the various complications that arose.
            The Gauls were a tribal society with many factions and many differences from one another. 
            However, when Caesar threatened to overthrow them, 
            they put those differences aside and united under one banner led by a man named Vercingetorix. 
            Vercingetorix would go on to lead the Gauls in the Battle of Alesia.

                the decisive engagement in the Roman civil war between Julius Caesar and Pompey the Great. 
                After failing to subdue his enemies at Dyrrhachium, 
                Caesar clashed with Pompey somewhere near Pharsalus. 
                Although Caesar was greatly outnumbered, 
                his veteran legions successfully routed Pompey’s 
                diverse but undisciplined levies. Pompey’s flight to Egypt and subsequent murder handed the ultimate victory to Caesar.

                The Battle of Dyrrachium took place from April to late July 48 BC near the city of Dyrrachium, modern day Durrës in what is now Albania.
                It was fought between Gaius Julius Caesar and an army led by Gnaeus Pompey during Caesar's civil war.
                Caesar attempted to capture the vital Pompeian logistics hub of Dyrrachium but was unsuccessful after Pompey occupied it and the surrounding heights. 
                In response, Caesar besieged Pompey's camp and constructed a circumvallation thereof, until, 
                after months of skirmishes, Pompey was able to break through Caesar's fortified lines, forcing Caesar to make a strategic retreat into Thessaly.
                After the battle, Pompey pursued Caesar into Thessaly and then towards Pharsalus, where the decisive battle of Caesar's Greek campaign would be fought.
