            The Battle of Alesia took place in 52 BCE when Roman troops, led by Roman governor Julius Caesar, 
            fought the Gauls at the city of Alesia. The Gauls had rebelled against Caesar's rule and fortified themselves within the city, 
            located in eastern Gaul, now commonly believed to be Burgundy, France. Caesar was victorious in this battle, 
            despite the various complications that arose.
            The Gauls were a tribal society with many factions and many differences from one another. 
            However, when Caesar threatened to overthrow them, 
            they put those differences aside and united under one banner led by a man named Vercingetorix. 
            Vercingetorix would go on to lead the Gauls in the Battle of Alesia.

                the decisive engagement in the Roman civil war between Julius Caesar and Pompey the Great. 
                After failing to subdue his enemies at Dyrrhachium, 
                Caesar clashed with Pompey somewhere near Pharsalus. 
                Although Caesar was greatly outnumbered, 
                his veteran legions successfully routed Pompey’s 
                diverse but undisciplined levies. Pompey’s flight to Egypt and subsequent murder handed the ultimate victory to Caesar.
