            <h2>Ceasar strenghts</h2>
            <h3>Leadership</h3>
            <p>The available sources suggest that Caesar exercised a ‘hands-on’,
                personal style of leadership. There is little evidence of the systematic use of written orders or of
                what we
                might recognise as specialised staff work.
            </p>
            <h3>Intelligence</h3>
            <p>
                In the search for useful intelligence, Caesar interrogated prisoners and deserters in person, and
                summoned councils of war when he saw fit.
                In combat, he moved around the field to assess the changing situation and to encourage his troops,
                his trademark scarlet cloak making him easily recognisable.
            </p>
            <h3>Loyalty</h3>
            <p>
                Caesar knew how to win and retain the allegiance of his men. He led them on rigorous marches and
                exercises as part of their training. This was the more remarkable because his health was uncertain and
                he is believed to have suffered from epilepsy. He insisted on strict discipline, but was also careful to
                show his gratitude, and to lavish praise on deserving soldiers.
            </p>

            <p>all of these traits made him the legendary general he was and made him win these legendary battles</p>

                            Battle of Alesia, (52 BCE), Roman military blockade of Alesia, a city in eastern Gaul,
                            during the Gallic Wars. Roman forces under the command of Julius Caesar besieged Alesia,
                            within which sheltered the Gallic general Vercingetorix and his massive host. Caesar
                            directed his troops to erect a series of extensive fortifications, including two walls
                            encircling the city, to keep the defenders in and potential reinforcements out.
                            Vercingetorix’s resistance and eventual surrender marked the final major military engagement
                            of the Gallic Wars, securing Roman authority over Gaul in its entirety.

                            Following the start of the Civil War, Caesar had captured Rome, forced Pompey and his allies
                            to withdraw from Italy, and defeated Pompey's legates in Spain. In the campaign season for
                            48 BC, Caesar crossed the Adriatic and advanced on Dyrrachium. There, he besieged it, but
                            was defeated.

                        </p>

                        <p>Caesar then withdrew east into Thessaly, partly to relieve one of his legates from attack by
                            Metellus Scipio's forces arriving from Syria. He besieged Gomphi after it resisted him.
                            Pompey pursued, seeking to spare Italy from invasion by concluding the war on Greek soil, to
                            prevent Caesar from defeating Metellus Scipio's forces arriving from Syria, and under
                            pressure from his overconfident allies who accused him of prolonging the war to extend his
                            command</p>
                        <p>
                            the decisive engagement in the Roman civil war between Julius Caesar and Pompey the Great.
                            After failing to subdue his enemies at Dyrrhachium,
                            Caesar clashed with Pompey somewhere near Pharsalus.
                            Although Caesar was greatly outnumbered,
                            his veteran legions successfully routed Pompey’s
                            diverse but undisciplined levies. Pompey’s flight to Egypt and subsequent murder handed the
                            ultimate victory to Caesar.

                        The Battle of Dyrrachium took place from April to late July 48 BC near the city of Dyrrachium,
                        modern day Durrës in what is now Albania.
                        It was fought between Gaius Julius Caesar and an army led by Gnaeus Pompey during Caesar's civil
                        war.
                        Caesar attempted to capture the vital Pompeian logistics hub of Dyrrachium but was unsuccessful
                        after Pompey occupied it and the surrounding heights.
                        In response, Caesar besieged Pompey's camp and constructed a circumvallation thereof, until,
                        after months of skirmishes, Pompey was able to break through Caesar's fortified lines, forcing
                        Caesar to make a strategic retreat into Thessaly.
                        After the battle, Pompey pursued Caesar into Thessaly and then towards Pharsalus, where the
                        decisive battle of Caesar's Greek campaign would be fought.
